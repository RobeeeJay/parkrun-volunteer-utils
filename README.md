# Parkrun Volunteer Utilities
Things to make it easier for parkrun volunteers, which is... right now... one thing!

## Milestones
Getting a list of milestones that are nice to celebrate for an upcoming Parkrun can be a horrible time consuming task, which is prone to error. Now it's prone to less error! Or maybe it's just now prone to computer error.

# Installation

## Windows 10/11
Download the latest EXE file from the [release page](https://github.com/RobeeeJay/parkrun-volunteer-utils/releases), put it anywhere you want it to live and run it from there

## MacOS
Either download the DMG file from the [release page](https://github.com/RobeeeJay/parkrun-volunteer-utils/releases) and install it to your Application folder from that, or you can download the ZIP file and extract it from there and put it somewhere you like.
When running any new version for the first time, you will need to give it permission to run by following [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) on the Apple website, maybe one day I will join the Apple Developer Program but it's $99 a year and it feels a little not worth it right now.
